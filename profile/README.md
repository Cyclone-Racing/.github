# Formula SAE

Formula SAE Teams design, build, test, and race a formula-style race car each year to compete with approximately 450 teams worldwide at several Formula SAE Series events. Most aspects of being a professional racing team are evaluated and judged, and the team operates largely from private sponsorship with support from Iowa State University. Teams must demonstrate a top-performing racing machine on the track, and also demonstrate their working knowledge in engineering and marketing through a series of presentation events.

If you are wondering why we do this, the answer is simple. We have fun! As future professionals, we appreciate taking the extra effort to gain real-world experience and learn about new, cutting-edge technologies that deal with a race car's design, manufacturing, and testing. The experiences and friends gained through such a team are invaluable to our futures.
