## Iowa State University

Cyclone Racingâ€™s Formula Team designs, builds, tests, and races a formula style race car each year to compete with approximately 450 teams from all around the world at several Formula SAE Series events. Most aspects of being a professional racing team are evaluated and judged, and the team operates largely from private sponsorship with support from Iowa State University. Teams must demonstrate a top-performing racing machine on the track, and also demonstrate their working knowledge in engineering and marketing through a series of presentation events.

If you are wondering why we do this, the answer is simple. We have fun! As future professionals we appreciate taking the extra effort to gain real-world experience and learn about new, cutting-edge technologies that deal with the design, manufacturing, and testing of a race car. We usually find ourselves spending more time on the car than in the classroom. The experiences and friends gained through such a team are invaluable to our futures. The only requirement for members is that they be students; all majors are welcome!
